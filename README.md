### All About Typography

In this project, I explore various components of typography. I discuss the importance of headlines, the use of different font styles for headings and body text, and the use of quotes. I also delve into the use of CSS properties like `text-transform` for changing the case of text.

### New Section

This section introduces the concept of using CSS to transform text case, specifically into Title Case. It also includes sample text under different headings to demonstrate the visual impact of different heading levels.

### Common Font Sizing Approaches

This section discusses different approaches to font sizing in CSS, including the use of pixels (`px`), em units (`em`), and root em units (`rem`). It provides a comparison of these methods and offers guidance on when to use each one.
